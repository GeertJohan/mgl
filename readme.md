## mgl
mgl is an application to manage the **M**SI **G**T **L**eds

**This application is under development and is not finished yet.**

### Goal:
Once this project is finished I will provide compilation instructions. I might also provide pre-build binaries for linux.

This project now only works under linux, but I might make it cross-platform compatible once I have all features working under linux.
I'm also thinking about creating a cross-platform GTK application (gui).

### Ideas/features:
 - Waves
 - Heatmap

### HID
This project uses go.hid to communicate with the leds usb hid. For more information about go.hid visit https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.hid

### History:
This project started to rewrite https://github.com/PaNaVTEC/MSI_GT_GE_Led_Enabler in Go and add more features.
